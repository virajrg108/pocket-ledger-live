## How to Use (Mobile Guide)

PocketLedger is optimized for mobile screens. Below is a quick overview of how to navigate and use the core features on your phone:

### 1. Initial Setup (Settings)
Start by navigating to the **Settings** tab. Here, you can configure your custom accounts (like your checking account, wallet, or credit card) and set their initial real-world balances.

### 2. Logging Transactions (New Entry)
Tap the green **New Entry** button to log a transaction. 
- Log your daily expenses as a **Debit**.
- Log your income as a **Credit**.
- Use **Transfer** when paying off your credit card from your bank account. Transfers safely move money between your accounts without artificially inflating your total monthly expenses!
